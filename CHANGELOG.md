# Changelog

## Unreleased

- Dropped support for Python 2. Only maintained versions of Python are supported (currently Python 3.7 onwards)
- Support newer requests-cache version (0.6 onwards)
  [PR #97](https://github.com/dbr/tvdb_api/pull/97)
- Removed deprecated `tvdb_*` exceptions (e.g `tvdb_error` is now `TvdbError`)
- Remove deprecated `Tvdb(forceConnect=...)` option
- Remove 'search_all_languages' option - had no effect
- Remove `self.log` from custom UI's (which inherit from `BaseUI` etc)

## `3.1` - 2021-04-29

- Rename exceptions to conventional PEP8 naming syntax, e.g `tvdb_error` becomes `TvdbError`, `tvdb_episodenotfound` becomes `TvdbEpisodeNotFound` etc. All exceptions have changed. Backwards-compatible bindings to old names exist until next version (i.e will be removed in version 3.2)
- Deprecate `Tvdb(forceConnect=...)` argument - had no effect in recent versions, and argument removed in next version.
- New `TvdbDataNotFound` exception allows catching of all missing-data exceptions in on (`TvdbShowNotFound`, `TvdbSeasonNotFound`, `TvdbEpisodeNotFound`, `TvdbResourceNotFound` are now all subclasses of this)
- Fix `ImportError: cannot import name '_to_bytes'` error due to change in [requests-cache 0.6.0](https://github.com/reclosedev/requests-cache/blob/master/HISTORY.md#060-2021-04-09) - [issue #92](https://github.com/dbr/tvdb_api/issues/92)
- TVDB v1 API compatbility remapping has been removed: for example `t[show][1][23]['seriesname']` must now be `t[show][1][23]['seriesName']`

## `3.0.2` - 2020-05-16

- Bug fix for `ConsoleUI` error `NameError: global name 'lid_map' is not defined`

## `3.0.1` - 2020-05-11
